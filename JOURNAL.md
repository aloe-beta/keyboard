## 10/22/2025 - Created schematic  

I'm following the split keyboard guide as a first project on here. I spend most of my time reading through documentation to find a microcontroller that would work with the split layout I planned, and re-learning how to use KiCAD (it's been a while). I skipped adding a battery sensor pin, as the microcontroller I selected appears to have that built-in. I added a TRRS jack to share power when charging and to transmit data over a wired connection between the halves.

## 10/23/2025 - Routed PCBs  

I routed both PCBs, connected to each other through mousebites. I ended up adding more mounting holes and changing the battery test pads into a single double testpad on the schematic, to add a JST connector for the battery on each PCB (footprint-symbol linking).

## 10/24/2025 - Rerouted PCB  

Apparently I put all the switch brackets on the wrong side of the board. I deleted all the traces, moved the brackets to the back, and rerouted everything. I figured this time I might as well make the traces follow a more consistent layout, so I cleaned things up a bit with those as well.
