## 10/22/2025 - Created schematic  

I'm following the split keyboard guide as a first project on here. I spend most of my time reading through documentation to find a microcontroller that would work with the split layout I planned, and re-learning how to use KiCAD (it's been a while). I skipped adding a battery sensor pin, as the microcontroller I selected appears to have that built-in. I added a TRRS jack to share power when charging and to transmit data over a wired connection between the halves.
